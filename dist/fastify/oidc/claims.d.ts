/**
 * Shape of FlowCatalyst token claims, and the mapping to a principal.
 *
 * Source of truth: the Go platform's
 * `internal/platform/auth/authservice` — `AccessTokenClaims` and
 * `IDTokenClaims`. Layout note: the tenancy tier lives in `tier`
 * ("ANCHOR" | "PARTNER" | "CLIENT"); `scope` is the OPTIONAL granted OAuth
 * scope — a space-delimited permission list. Legacy tokens from older
 * platform versions carried the tier IN `scope`; the mapper below accepts
 * both layouts.
 *
 * ## The identity/API token split
 *
 * An `authorization_code` login mints an IDENTITY access token by default:
 * it proves who signed in and carries NO authority — no scope, no roles, no
 * applications, no client access. The platform API rejects it, so a user
 * signing in cannot hand the app an API credential. The user's real
 * authority travels on the **ID token**, narrowed to the applications the
 * OAuth client is scoped to.
 *
 * A first-party client flagged `apiAccess` mints an authority-bearing access
 * token on the same flow (also narrowed to the client's applications). Both
 * shapes are handled: {@link mergeIdTokenAuthority} overlays the ID token's
 * authority onto the access token's identity, so the resulting principal is
 * correct either way, and `client_credentials` (which has no ID token) is
 * untouched.
